## Exploring_67_Years_of_Lego
 In this project we will explore a database of every LEGO set ever built.
 
 
## Project Description
The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that ever been sold. The names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, you will get to explore the Rebrickable database. To do this you need to know your way around pandas dataframes and this project requires the knowledge of PANDAS library to manipulate Dataframes.


## Library Used:
 I used PANDAS to explore and manipulate the dataset which was converted from a csv file to a pandas dataframe.
